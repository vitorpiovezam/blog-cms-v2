In Brazil we have an sacrated holiday, the Carnival. Even with COVID situation, without fests and the tradional samba schools public performances, the holiday still valid in some companies.

The bank who I currently work gave us time off on the 15th and 16th of February. So i maded a travel to Ilha Grande, a very preserved island in Brazil, based at Angra dos Reis - Rio de Janeiro.

</p>

Ilha Grande is a very known place by me, since I was child, my father, who is from Rio de Janeiro, used to take me there when I was a kid. I must have gone from 2009 to 2013, annually.

But like the name says (Big Island), there is so much places to explore, environmental reserves and beaches. The common place is on coast side, called Vila do Abraao. But on foot, with trails you can see the ocean in another side.

Now we can go to the point, my expedition.

## The Plan

Two trails, to Dois Rios (already maded by me 3 times), and Dois Rios to the final destination, Parnaioca. Where I pretend to camping 3 days, rest and return.

## Stage 1

I think you, my reader, already know that I'm from Sao Paulo. The bus there I taked to Angra left me 6.3km far from the boats, to reach the Island I needed to walk on Angra dos Reis streets. 

I was think to take a uber, but I was inspired by the adventure spirit, and for a cheaper travel üí∏.

</p>
Climbing the 780 meters of altitude on the first trail, I started to sweat too much, due to the 15kg backpack I carried on my back, containing all the camping material, some food and 4l of water.

### Dois Rios Beach

Like the name says, (Two Rivers), Dois Rios is a beutiful beach with two rivers at the ends, left and right. So you can enjoy the sea salty water and the river cold freshwater too.

After this amazing view and good rest on those clean waters, I package all my stuff again and continue to Parnaioca.
<br>

## Stage 2

With soft rain, I`ve started walking to the next destinantion, Parnaioca beach.

This trail was much more difficult, besides being my first time, it was narrower and more confusing. Due to the rain and the closed forest, it was very hot and humid, it was getting difficult to keep my feet dry.

And here is the great point of this adventure
**I`ve got lost**

Following the trail, I've came up on a downside river, and I couldn't see the trail continuation. 
I saw a bunch of rocks upstairs, so I started to climb, to get nowhere.

When I started to go down to return to the trail, I didn't find it. I arrived at the end of the river, where it fell into the sea and had an amazing view.

The moment I concluded that I was lost was very bad, in my mind passed bad things, I remembered my families and friends and started to think in SOS stuff. I had a lignthing to sinalize to the boats, but in 30 minutes no boat passed on my view, and started to get darker. So I left my backpack downside of the river and started to climb again to find the trail.

<br>

**I find the trail back ü•≥**, on the left of the river where did I came from. I left some camping stuff to mark the beggining of the trail, and get down again to camping and spend the night, to walk back on next morning.

I spend a lot of energy climbing those rocks.

</p>

## Stage 3, the return

With no water, drinking just in some points of fresh water on the trail, this was the more hard segment.

I hadn't thought about it, but camping in the middle of nature is noisy, many animals go out at night, so it was difficult to concentrate and I didn't have a good night's sleep.

**I was weak, tired and hungry.**
<br>
<p align="middle">

<br>
  <small>Way back, I was so tired that I cant even turn on GPS, all focused to keep walking</small>
</p>
<br>
This was so far the most challenging moment of my life. In half of the walk, the 4G/GSM signal back to my phone, so I talk to my parents and I was much safer for having an emergency resource.
<br>
<br>

My body started to miss nutrients, I started to sweat too much and lose a lot of liquid.
For the last 2km I walked like a zombie, my arms, legs and feets were completely fatigued.

When I come up the first traces of civilizations, some home from Island residents, I get some water from a gentle woman. Buied some Ice Creams and drink a Coke. 

**The best Ice Cream and the best Coke of my life...**

## End
After come in Vila do Abraao, I've checked in at [Pousada Telhado Azul](https://www.tripadvisor.com.br/Hotel_Review-g303497-d2261865-Reviews-Pousada_Telhado_Azul-Ilha_Grande_Angra_Dos_Reis_State_of_Rio_de_Janeiro.html). Well-known and trusted for a decade in my family. Based on Rua do Bicao.

I was left with an insatiable hunger for the next few days, and the pain in my legs only got worse. So I passed a long time at the Hotel resting, eated a lot of food üçñ and give a few walks on near beaches.

I have been in nature, in moments lost, in moments happy. I saw incredible landscapes, wild animals. I managed calmly and logically to solve my problems and return home safely.

Was my first trekking, passing one day in wild nature. 
The best trip of my life.
